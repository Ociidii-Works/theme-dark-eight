# Dark Eight Theme

**We have obtained ownership of the original repo and transferred it here.**
The original repo resided at ShawnMcCool/theme-dark-eight and credit goes to him for most of the work (as of August 2014).

### About Dark Eight

> I finally found a theme that I liked but it wasn't DARK enough. So, here I present Dark Eight.

> Some aspects of it are a bit messy internally. But, it works perfectly as far as I can tell.

> At some point in time I may clean up the theme internals.. or feel free to contribute.
